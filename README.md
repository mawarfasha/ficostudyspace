## 📖 About This Project

Fico Study Space is a modern productivity platform designed to help students and professionals maintain focus and accountability during study sessions. Born from observing the dedication and persistence of hardworking students, this project aims to bridge the gap between mobile timelapse tools and comprehensive study productivity features.

### 💡 Personal Vision

> *"This project exists because of witnessing true dedication in action. Watching students struggle with the balance between using their phones for timelapse recording while needing them for study-related tasks sparked the idea for a unified solution. It's not just a tool—it's a tribute to the persistence and determination of every student working toward their goals."*

The vision is to create a seamless digital study environment where accountability, focus, and productivity converge into a single, powerful web application.
