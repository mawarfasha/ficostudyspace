My next project is a website that compiles simple, codable games similar to handheld retro-style games, but with a unique twist. While there are already many game collections online, what makes this project stand out is the built-in programming environment.

The idea is not just to let people play, but to also show how the games work behind the scenes. As the game runs, the website will display the logic, movement, and processes happening in real-time, giving users a clear view of what powers each interaction. This makes the project both fun and educational bridging entertainment with programming insight.

The goal is to make coding less intimidating by connecting it to something familiar and enjoyable: games. Players can enjoy the nostalgia of retro-inspired gameplay, while learners and curious minds can peek into the mechanics that bring it to life.

This project will not only enrich my portfolio, but also reflect my passion for combining creativity, interactivity, and technical exploration.
