Hi! I'm the one running fico-project, and I’m someone who enjoys exploring technology, creativity, and everything in between. I’ve always been curious about how things work behind the screen, which led me into programming and web development. While I’m still learning and improving my technical skills, I enjoy experimenting with different tools, frameworks, and ideas, whether it’s building small projects, designing something useful, or just tinkering around to see what I can create. For me, programming is not just about solving problems, but also about exploring new possibilities and continuously growing.

Outside of coding, I like to balance things out with hobbies that help me relax. I spend a good amount of time playing calm, relaxing games, which not only help me recharge but also give me fresh perspectives on design and user experience. I also enjoy watching YouTube, where I explore a mix of tutorials, gaming content, and lifestyle videos that inspire me both personally and creatively.

Right now, I see myself as a learner, constantly picking up technical knowledge while shaping my own path in technology. My goal is to keep improving, build meaningful projects, and eventually create something that others can benefit from.
