The inspiration for this website comes from Ashav, someone I deeply admire for her dedication and discipline. She spends countless hours studying, almost 24/7, and I often noticed her using her phone to record timelapses of her sessions. It was her way of keeping herself accountable, tracking her progress, and staying motivated. 

However, there was one recurring problem: while her phone worked as a timelapse tool, she also needed it for research and study-related tasks. This made it difficult for her to balance both purposes effectively. At the same time, I realized that laptops, which students often rely on for serious study and work, don’t really have good or simple timelapse solutions. Most existing tools are either too complicated, lacking in functionality, or not designed with students in mind. This gap sparked the idea. 

What if there was a website where students could both study and record their timelapses without needing their phones? 

From watching Ashav’s persistence and hardworking nature, I felt inspired to create this project. It’s not just a tool, but also a tribute to her effort and determination. This website exists because of her example, and I credit her dedication as the motivation behind its creation.
