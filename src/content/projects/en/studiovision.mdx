My startup is a self-initiated journey into web development, experimentation, and personal growth. It began as a passion project, created with the goal of learning by doing, turning ideas into functional websites and applications while developing both technical and creative skills. Instead of focusing solely on polished, large-scale projects, I approach this startup as a space for exploration. It allows me to experiment with different programming languages, frameworks, and tools, testing out what works best and what sparks new ideas.

At its core, this startup is not just about building websites, but about creating a foundation for continuous learning. Each project I take on whether itâ€™s a simple landing page, a productivity tool, or a more complex web application that teaches me something new. These lessons contribute to my growth as a developer and help me build confidence in solving real-world problems.

Beyond coding, this startup represents independence and creativity. It pushes me to think critically, manage my time, and bring structure to my ideas. While the projects are experimental in nature, the ultimate goal is to create solutions that can help others while shaping my portfolio. This startup is both my classroom and my launchpad for future opportunities.
